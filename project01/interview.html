				I think the best moment was New Year’s Eve. It was just really fun 
				<br>
				because I have a younger brother who’s like 18 and then older 
				<br>
				sister and we had a bunch of friends there and then we just 
				<br>
				all kind of came <s>together</s>and it was really fun. Just, I don’t 
				<br>
				know,it was fun to go out with my younger brother for the 
				<br>
				first time. It was just really <s>a great way to start the new year.</s>

				<a>my family. They live u</a>ptown, so I went up town to see them and I spent 
				<br>
				<a>Christmas in the city</a> and then I went to Switzerland to go skiing with my 
				<br>
				<a>family and our family</a> friends from Denmark. And then there pretty much 
				<br>
				<a>was just skiing and s</a>pending time with my friends. And then when I got 
				<br>
				<a>back I went with my</a> older sister to Palm beach and it was nice cause we 
				<br>
				<a>just got to spend tim</a>e together and relax.
