				I think the best moment was New Year’s Eve. It was just really fun 
				<br>
				because I have a younger brother who’s like 18 and then older 
				<br>
				sister and we had like a bunch of friends there and then we just 
				<br>
				all kind of came <strong>together</strong> and it was really fun. Just, I don’t 
				<br>
				know, it was fun to go out with my younger brother for the first 
				<br>
				time. It was just really <strong>a great way to start the new year.</strong>

				Hey Chloe ! So what did you do 
				<br>
				during winter break? 
		</div>
		<div class="sentence4">
				During winter break, my family lives in New York, so I went back to see 
				
				my family. They live uptown, so I went up town to see them and I spent 
				
				Christmas in the city and then I went to Switzerland to go skiing with my 
				
				family and our family friends from Denmark. And then there pretty much 
				
				was just skiing and spending time with my friends. And then when I got 
				
				back I went with my older sister to Palm beach and it was nice cause we 
				
				just got to spend time together and relax.
